description: Enoyl-CoA (trans-delta2-enoyl-CoA) is the unsaturated thioester intermediate
  formed in the first step of each beta-oxidation cycle when acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  oxidizes fatty acyl-CoA, introducing a trans double bond between C2 and C3. It is
  subsequently hydrated by enoyl-CoA hydratase to form L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. Enoyl-CoA
  represents a critical checkpoint in fatty acid oxidation, as defects in its formation
  or processing underlie several inherited metabolic disorders.

<h1>Enoyl-CoA</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Enoyl-CoA (trans-delta2-enoyl-CoA) is the unsaturated thioester intermediate formed in the first step of each beta-oxidation cycle. When acyl-CoA dehydrogenase removes two hydrogen atoms from the alpha (C2) and beta (C3) carbons of a fatty acyl-CoA, a trans-configured carbon-carbon double bond is introduced, yielding enoyl-CoA and transferring electrons to enzyme-bound FAD. The trans geometry is essential — only the trans isomer is a substrate for the next enzyme, enoyl-CoA hydratase, which adds water stereospecifically across the double bond to produce L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA.</p>
<p>The enoyl-CoA intermediate is a transient species in normal metabolism, rapidly processed by the highly efficient enoyl-CoA hydratase (turnover number approximately 100,000/min for crotonase). However, it accumulates when there are defects in the downstream enzymes or when the electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) system that shuttles FADH2 electrons to the respiratory chain is impaired. Accumulated enoyl-CoA intermediates are diverted to alternative pathways, including the formation of dicarboxylic acids and the generation of reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>Enoyl-CoA exists as a family of molecules varying in chain length, each processed by specific enzyme isoforms optimized for different substrate sizes. Short-chain (C4-C6), medium-chain (C6-C12), and long-chain (C12-C20) enoyl-CoAs are handled by the corresponding acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and hydratase isoforms, with the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) being the most abundant and clinically significant. The unsaturated bond in enoyl-CoA also makes it a reactive electrophilic species that can form Michael adducts with cellular nucleophiles under conditions of metabolic stress.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Formation by Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase</h3>
<p>Fatty acyl-CoA + FAD(enzyme) → trans-delta2-Enoyl-CoA + FADH2(enzyme)</p>
<p>This is the initial and rate-determining oxidation in each beta-oxidation cycle. The reaction mechanism involves:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Substrate binding:</strong> The fatty acyl-CoA binds in the active site with C2-C3 positioned adjacent to enzyme-bound FAD</li>
<li><strong>Proton abstraction:</strong> A glutamate residue acts as a general base, abstracting the alpha-proton from C2</li>
<li><strong>Hydride transfer:</strong> Electrons are transferred as a hydride from C3 to FAD, forming the trans double bond</li>
<li><strong>Product release:</strong> Enoyl-CoA dissociates; FADH2 remains enzyme-bound</li>
</ol>
<p>The stereospecificity for the trans isomer is absolute — the enzyme active site geometry ensures that only the trans double bond is formed. Cis-unsaturated fatty acids (from dietary fats) require additional enzymatic steps (enoyl-CoA isomerase and 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase) to convert their cis double bonds to the trans configuration required for continued beta-oxidation.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Hydration by Enoyl-CoA Hydratase</h3>
<p>trans-delta2-Enoyl-CoA + H2O → L-3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA</p>
<p>Enoyl-CoA hydratase (also called crotonase, named after its model substrate crotonyl-CoA) catalyzes the stereospecific addition of water across the trans double bond:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hydroxyl group is added to C3 in the L-configuration</li>
<li>The reaction is nearly diffusion-limited (kcat approximately 100,000/min)</li>
<li>The enzyme uses an oxyanion hole mechanism to stabilize the enolate intermediate</li>
<li>Only trans-delta2-enoyl-CoA is a substrate; cis isomers are not hydrated</li>
</ul>
<h3>Electron Disposal from FADH2</h3>
<p>The FADH2 produced by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase does not enter the electron transport chain directly. Instead, it follows a dedicated pathway:</p>
<ol>
<li>FADH2 transfers electrons to electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF)</li>
<li>ETF transfers electrons to ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO)</li>
<li>ETF-QO reduces ubiquinone (CoQ) in the inner mitochondrial membrane</li>
<li>Electrons enter the respiratory chain at Complex III via the Q pool</li>
</ol>
<p>This pathway yields approximately 1.5 ATP per FADH2 from the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase step.</p>

<h2>Clinical Significance</h2>
<h3>MCAD Deficiency</h3>
<p>The most common fatty acid oxidation disorder (1:15,000 in Caucasians, higher in Northern European populations):</p>
<ul>
<li>Caused by mutations in the ACADM gene, most commonly the K304E missense mutation</li>
<li>Impaired oxidation of medium-chain enoyl-CoA intermediates (C6-C12)</li>
<li>Accumulation of medium-chain acylcarnitines (C8, C10, C10:1) detectable by newborn screening</li>
<li>Clinical presentation: fasting hypoketotic hypoglycemia, vomiting, lethargy, seizures</li>
<li>Can present as sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) if undiagnosed</li>
<li>Management: avoid fasting, provide frequent meals, emergency glucose during illness</li>
<li>Newborn screening has reduced mortality from approximately 25% to less than 2%</li>
</ul>
<h3>VLCAD Deficiency</h3>
<p>Less common but more severe than MCAD deficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impaired processing of long-chain enoyl-CoAs (C14-C24)</li>
<li>Three clinical phenotypes: severe early-onset (cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, death), hepatic (hypoketotic hypoglycemia), and myopathic (exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis)</li>
<li>Long-chain acylcarnitine accumulation (C14:1 is the diagnostic marker)</li>
<li>Treatment: avoid fasting, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation to bypass the enzyme defect</li>
</ul>
<h3>Glutaric Acidemia Type II (Multiple Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency)</h3>
<p>Caused by defects in ETF or ETF-QO, which affect all acyl-CoA dehydrogenases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impaired electron disposal from all enoyl-CoA-forming reactions</li>
<li>Accumulation of multiple acylcarnitine species</li>
<li>Severe neonatal form: metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, congenital anomalies</li>
<li>Riboflavin-responsive form: milder, treatable with high-dose riboflavin (B2, cofactor for ETF/ETF-QO)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) Dependency</h3>
<p>Both acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and ETF/ETF-QO are FAD-dependent flavoproteins that require riboflavin-derived cofactors. Riboflavin deficiency impairs enoyl-CoA formation and electron disposal, causing secondary FAO dysfunction. High-dose riboflavin supplementation (100-400 mg/day) is used to treat riboflavin-responsive forms of glutaric acidemia type II and some mild ACAD variants.</p>
