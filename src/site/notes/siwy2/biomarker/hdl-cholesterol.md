description: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is the cardioprotective
  lipoprotein fraction responsible for reverse cholesterol transport — moving cholesterol
  from peripheral tissues and arterial walls back to the liver for excretion. Low
  HDL-C is a component of metabolic syndrome and an independent cardiovascular risk
  factor.

<h1>HDL Cholesterol</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is the fraction of cholesterol carried by HDL particles, which perform reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) — the process of removing excess cholesterol from arterial walls and peripheral tissues and returning it to the liver for biliary excretion. HDL particles also have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and endothelial-protective properties.</p>
<p>Epidemiologically, low HDL-C is inversely associated with cardiovascular risk: each 1 mg/dL increase in HDL-C is associated with a 2-3% reduction in cardiovascular risk. Low HDL-C is one of the five diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome. However, Mendelian randomization studies and clinical trials of CETP inhibitors (which raise HDL-C) suggest that pharmacologically raising HDL-C alone may not reduce cardiovascular risk — the protective effect may be more about HDL function than concentration.</p>
<p>HDL-C is measured as part of the standard lipid panel. Secondary causes of low HDL-C include smoking, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, insulin resistance, and certain medications (beta-blockers, anabolic steroids).</p>

<li>HDL-C &gt;60 mg/dL is considered cardioprotective and counts as a negative risk factor in ASCVD risk calculation.</li>
<li>Very high HDL-C (&gt;100 mg/dL) may indicate genetic variants (e.g., CETP deficiency) and is not always protective.</li>
