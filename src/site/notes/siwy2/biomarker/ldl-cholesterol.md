description: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary atherogenic
  lipoprotein and the main target of lipid-lowering therapy. Elevated LDL-C is a causal
  risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), with each 1 mmol/L
  (38.7 mg/dL) reduction associated with a 22% relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular
  events.

<h1>LDL Cholesterol</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary carrier of cholesterol in the blood and the principal atherogenic lipoprotein. LDL particles transport cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues. When LDL-C levels are elevated, LDL particles infiltrate the arterial wall, undergo oxidation, and are taken up by macrophages to form foam cells — the hallmark of early atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>LDL-C is the primary target of lipid-lowering therapy and the cornerstone of cardiovascular risk assessment. The relationship between LDL-C and cardiovascular risk is log-linear: there is no lower threshold below which risk reduction ceases. This was confirmed by Mendelian randomization studies and clinical trials of PCSK9 inhibitors.</p>
<p>Modern guidelines (ACC/AHA 2018, ESC/EAS 2019) use LDL-C as the basis for risk-enhancing factor assessment and treatment decisions. While the Friedewald formula has traditionally estimated LDL-C, newer methods like the Martin/Hopkins algorithm and direct assays provide more accurate results, especially at LDL-C &lt;70 mg/dL.</p>
